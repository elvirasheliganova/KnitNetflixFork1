    desc: 'Most sock patterns use very thin yarn and equally thin needles. If you want to wear your sock every day (and not just in winter), then you really have no other choice to produce a light and breathable fabric that doesn’t turn your shoes into a sauna. Still, this sock recipe will work out with DK weight yarn as well (and 3.00 mm needles) just as fine. Kindly note that I will be knitting these socks using three different colors. I am doing this so I can show you how to knit the popular stripes. If you like the way that looks then you need one 100 grams skein and two 50 grams skeins of the same yarn base (don’t mix brands!!!). But you can also knit with just one color and it will actually be easier',
